ABOUT hexgrid

    Package hexgrid implements a n by n hexagonal grid. A grid can be
    used in games with a hex-tile layout such as the games of Hex,
    Settlers of Catan, and Sid Meier's Civilization 5.

    The Grid object has indexable tiles, vertices, and edges. The
    tiles, vertices, and edges can be used to hold arbitrary objects.
    And is navigatable as a graph no matter whether a game uses tile
    connections, vertex connections, or both.

INSTALLATION

    The following command will install hexgrid into the path
    $GOROOT/pkg/ARCH, where ARCH is your current architecture.

        gomake install
