//  Package hexgrid implements an n by m hex-tile grid for use in games.
//
//  The Grid object has indexable tiles, vertices, and edges. The
//  tiles, vertices, and edges can be used to hold arbitrary objects.
//  And is navigatable as a graph no matter whether a game uses tile
//  connections, vertex connections, or both.
